ConstraintKinds
===============

Implements common Haskell type classes using the constraint kinds pattern to allow constraints.  Currently, there are classes for Foldable, Functor, and Traversable and corresponding instances for [], Vector, and Vector.Unboxed.  That's because those are what I've been using and I haven't gotten around to adding anything else.
